<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p><b>Inter-Ed</b> is a 360-degree learning management system that allows educators to create or curate content from different sources to design courses. Students can enroll in these courses and view comprehensive analytics to track their progress. Users can upload two types of content: video lectures and blogs. Curators can create well-sequenced courses to facilitate easy learning in a user-friendly manner. This feature enables students to study from a single, consolidated source instead of browsing through hundreds of resources, saving them time. The student's experience can be customized based on their study preferences and interests. We use a recommendation algorithm to rank various courses and content for each user. Additionally, we perform sentiment analysis on user feedback to rank different categories of content." </p>
